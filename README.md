# revenue-leakage-analysis-subscription-business
This project focuses on identifying, quantifying, and diagnosing revenue leakage in a subscription-based business using a full end-to-end analytics workflow.  The objective is not just visualization, but business diagnosis — answering where revenue is leaking, why it is happening, and which areas require immediate action.
